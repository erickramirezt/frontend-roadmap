    <h1>accesibility role, name and value</h1>
    <h2>why</h2>
    <p>
      user interface components need a role, a name and sometimes a value, to
      ensure that people using assistive technologies are able to use them.
      examples of assistive technologies are screen readers, switch controls and
      speech recognition software
    </p>
    <h2>what</h2>
    <p>
      there are two cases where we can't use a good html element with built-in
      accesibility features. event though we want to
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>there is no native html element for what we are trying to achieve</li>
      <li>
        there are technical limitations that prevents us using the semantically
        correct element
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>how</h2>
    <p>
      how do we make sure that custom components have a role, a name and a
      value?
    </p>
    <h2>role</h2>
    <p>
      in our last section, buttons a links, we learned that dropdown menu button
      should be coded as a button. what if our framework does not allow us to do
      that? if it forces us to use an a instead? if the navegation component in
      the library we are using, is built with as? then we need to add a role
    </p>
    <p>
      this is done with the role="button" attribute. now users of assistive
      technologies can understand what the custom control is. a button has the
      role="button" built in, so to write button role="button" is redundant
    </p>
    <h2>name</h2>
    <p>
      the custom control needs a name. in out example, the name is the content
      of the element, company. as long as we have written our elements like div
      role="button" Company div, we have a good name. this is also known as the
      accesible name. the accesible name for our div is company. good
    </p>
    <p>
      in the following login form, we have several components - a logo, a
      heading, a label, a dropdown, an input and a button
    </p>
    <p>
      we are taking a closer look at the label, dropdown and the input. visually
      there is no clear distinction between the dropdown and the input. the
      dropdown is coded with a select, which is a correct element for this case.
      however, it has no name
    </p>
    <select name="countryCode"></select>
    <p>
      it has a name attribute. this is not the same as an accesible anme. the
      name attribute is for computers. in a form, it is used as a reference when
      the data is submitted. this name countryCode will not help any users. it
      will not be picked up by assistive technologies
    </p>
    <p>
      to give this select an accesible name, we must use the attribute
      aria-label. normally, we would have connected a visual label to the select
      component. in this case, there is only one visual label fot both the
      components
    </p>
    <select aria-label="Country calling code" name="countryCode"></select>

    <h2>value</h2>
    <p>
      some component have a value or a state. an accordion is open or closed.
      this informatino has to be accesible
    </p>
    <p>
      an accordion is considered a custom component. there is no standard html
      element to use here. each accordion header should be a button or
      role="button"
    </p>
    <div role="button">when do i get charged for a role</div>
    <p>
      good. it has the role of a button. it also has a name, the content of the
      div. to give this button a value, we need to tell assistive technologies
      that it is closed. this is done with aria-expanded="false"
    </p>
    <div role="button" aria-expanded="false">when do i get charged for a role</div>
  </body>
</html>
