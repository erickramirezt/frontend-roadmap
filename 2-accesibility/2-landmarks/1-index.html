    <h1>accesibility landmarks</h1>

    <h2>why</h2>
    <p>
      with landmarks, blind userd using a screen reader have the ability to jump
      to sections of a web page
    </p>

    <h2>what</h2>
    <p>
      in html there are some semantic elements that can be used to define
      different parts of a web page:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>header</li>
      <li>nav</li>
      <li>main</li>
      <li>aside</li>
      <li>section</li>
      <li>footer</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>how</h2>
    <p>
      the front page of the white house is using landmarks. it consists of a
      header at the top, a main containing all the main content and a footer
      with some nav elements at the bottom
    </p>
    <p>
      one way to visualize landmarks is to use the tool
      <a href="https://accessibilityinsights.io/">accesibility insights</a>. one
      of the features is that it highlights the landmarks, as we can see in the
      following screenshot
    </p>

    <h2>Roles</h2>
    <p>
      but wait, it shows banner, contentinfo and navigation. this is a bit
      confusing. the reason is that each landmark element has a corresponding
      role.
    </p>
    <p>
      a header has a built in role of banner. this means that both header,
      header role="banner" and div role="banner" are more or less equivalent.
      for most cases, header will be sufficient
    </p>
    <p>
      the same is true for nav, which has role="navigation" built in. main is
      easier, it has role="main". and then we have fotter with its
      role="contentinfo"
    </p>

    <h2>more than one of each landmark</h2>
    <p>
      a rule of thumb is to only use one main per page. when we use more than
      one type of landmark, like multiple navs, we must label each of them. this
      is done with attribute aria-label
    </p>
    <p>
      in the footer of the white house, we have three navs each with an
      aria-label, like aria-label="social navigation". this means that a screen
      reader user can skip directly to the social navigation.
      aria-label="social" should be fine though
    </p>

    <h2>the aside and section tags</h2>
    <p>
      ever since the landmarks were introduced to html, developers have been
      confused. two of the elements that people find vaguely defined are aside
      and section. the big difference is that an aside is related to the main
      content and the section is not related
    </p>
    <p>
      the contact page of the white house uses both and aside and a section. the
      three sharing buttons are inside an aside. this makes sense, they are
      related to the main content
    </p>
    <p>
      the stay connected is a section. it is not related to the main content,
      and no other landmark will be appropiate. one improvement that the white
      house can do with these landmarks is to add labels. this will be better
      for a screen reader user. secton aria-label="newsletter" and aside
      aria-label="share this page"
    </p>
