    <h1>accesibility buttons and links</h1>
    <h2>why</h2>
    <p>
      buttons and links are specific types of interactive components. each of
      them work different with assistive technologies. the correct use of each
      component helps users with assistive technologies to interact with the
      component
    </p>
    <h2>what</h2>
    <p>
      the button element should be used for any interaction that performs an
      action on the current page. the a element should be used for any
      interaction that navigates to another view.
    </p>
    <h2>how</h2>
    <p>
      in the introduction, we saw that the visual design does not dictate which
      html element we should use. a link that looks like a button, but behaves
      like a link, is an a
    </p>
    <p>
      both the button sign up to drive and the link underneath is coded as an a.
      so when should we use a button, then?
    </p>
    <p>
      the first section of the header has five elements - a logo, a dropdown
      menu and three links. one of them is coded as a button
    </p>
    <p>
      clicking company opens a drop down menu. this is an interaction that
      performs an action on the current page. using button here is the correct
      thing to do. the underlying links, about us, our offerings and son on, are
      correctly coded with a elements
    </p>
    <p>
      the arrow indicates that this is a button with a dropdown menu, that
      changes direction when opened. this is a nice extra visual cue
    </p>
    <p>
      one benefit with this, is that semantic html gives context to screen
      readers, which read the contents of a page out loud.
    </p>
    <p>in this case, a div is wrong. why?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>buttons have more suitable styling by default</li>
      <li>a screen reader identifies it as a button</li>
      <li>it is focusable</li>
      <li>it is clickable</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      both a link and a button are accesible for people relying on keyboard-only
      navigation; it can be clickable with both mouse and keys, and it can be
      tabbed between using the tab key on keyboard
    </p>

    <h2>proper links</h2>
    <p>
      links take users from one page to antoher, or sometimes to another part of
      the page. for a link to be accesible, remember to
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>use the href attribute to specify the link destination</li>
      <li>
        use a proper url in the href attribute. the url can be absolute or
        relative
      </li>
      <li>not simulate a link with other elements like span or div</li>
      <li>
        open the link in the current window. it is not recomended to open links
        in a new window
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      the link about us from the uber example is coded like this, a bit
      simplified
    </p>
    <a href="/about/">About us</a>
    <p>this is a proper and healthy link</p>
