    <h1>accesibility semantic elements</h1>
    <h2>semantic elements = elements with a meaning</h2>
    <p>
      provide the user a good way to navigate and interact with your site. make
      your html semantic. semantics is about using the correct element in html.
      there are approximately 110 elements in html
    </p>
    <p>
      two of them have no meaning - div and span. they tell us nothing about the
      content. they have no built in accesibility features, so we should always
      check to see if any other elements are better suited. example of semantic
      elements: form, table, article. they clearly define the content and its
      purpose.
    </p>
    <p>in this example, we have five elements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a heading</li>
      <li>a paragraph</li>
      <li>a button</li>
      <li>a link</li>
      <li>an image</li>
    </ul>

    <p>this is the code a bit simplified</p>
    <h2>get in the driver's seat and get paid</h2>
    <p>drive in the platform with largest network of active riders</p>
    <a href="/signup/drive/">sign up to drive</a>
    <a href="/en/drive/">learn more about driving and delivering</a>
    <img src="driver.jpg" alt="driver" />

    <p>
      this is semantically correct. the button is coded as a link, because it
      behaves like a link. it takes the user to another view. it does not matter
      that link is styled as a button. it is still a link.
    </p>

    <strong>
      the button element should be used for any interaction that performs an action on the current page. the a element should be used for any interaction that navigates to another view
    </strong>
