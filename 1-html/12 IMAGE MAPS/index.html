<!-- HTML IAMGE MAPS -->
<!-- WITH HTML IMAGE MAPS, YOU CAN CREATE CLICKABLE AREAS ON AN IMAGE -->

<!-- IMAGE MAPS -->
<!-- THE HTML <map> TAG DEFINES AN IMAGE MAP. AN IMAGE MAP IS AN IMAGEWITH CLICKABLE AREAS. THE AREAS ARE DEFINED
    WITH ONE OR MORE <area> TAGS -->
<!-- EXAMPLE -->
<img src="worplace.jpg" alt="WORKPLACE" usemap="#workmap" />

<map name="workmap">
  <area
    shape="rect"
    coords="34,44,270,350"
    href="computer.htm"
    alt="Computer"
  />
  <area shape="rect" coords="290,172,333,250" href="phone.htm" alt="Phone" />
  <area shape="circle" coords="337,300,44" href="coffee.htm" alt="Coffee" />
</map>

<!-- HOW DOES IT WORK -->
<!-- THE IDEA BEHIND AN IMAGE MAP IS THAT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO PERFORM DIFFERENT ACTIONS DEPENDING ON WHERE IN THE
IMAGE YOU CLICK -->
<!-- TO CREATE AN IMAGE MAP YOU NEED AN IMAGE, AND SOME HTML CODE THAT DESCRIBES THE CLICKABLE AREAS -->

<!-- THE IMAGE -->
<!-- THE IMAGE IS INSERTED USING THE <img> TAG. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE FROM OTHER IMAGES IS THAT YOU MUST ADD A USEMAP
ATTRIBUTE -->
<img src="worplace.jpg" alt="WORKPLACE" usemap="#workmap" />
<!-- THE USEMAP VALUE STARTS WITH A HASH TAG # FOLLOWED BY THE NAME OF THE IMAGE MAP, AND IS USED TO CREATE A 
    RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE IMAGE AND THE IMAGE MAP -->
<!-- TIP YOU CAN USE ANY IMAGE AS AN IMAGE MAP -->

<!-- CREATE IMAGE MAP -->
<!-- THEN, ADD A <map> ELEMENT -->
<!-- THE <map> ELEMENT IS USED TO CREATE AN IMAGE MAP, AND IS LINKED TO THE IMAGE BY USING THE REQUIRED NAME
    ATTRIBUTE -->
<map name="workmap"></map>
<!-- THE NAME ATTRIBUTE MUST HAVE THE SAME VALUE AS THE <img>'s USEMAP ATTRIBUTE -->

<!-- THE AREAS -->
<!-- THEN, ADD THE CLICKABLE AREAS -->
<!-- A CLICKABLE AREA IS DEFINED USING AN <area> ELEMENT -->

<!-- SHAPE -->
<!-- YU MUST DEFINE THE SHAPE OF THE CLICKABLE AREA, AND YOU CAN CHOOSE ONE OF THESE VALUES: -->
<!-- rect - defines a rectangular region
circle - defines a circular region
poly - defines a polygonal region
default - defines the entire region -->
<!-- YOU MUST ALSO DEFINE SOME COORDINATES TO BE ABLE TO PLACE THE CLICKABLE AREA ONTO THE IMAGE -->

<!-- SHAPE="RECT" -->
<!-- THE COORDINATES FOR SHAPE="RECT" COME IN PARIS, ONE FOR THE X-AXIS AND ONE FOR THE Y-AXIS -->
<!-- SO, THE COORDINATES 34,44 IS LOCATED 34 PIXELS FROM THE LEFT MARGIN AND 44 PIXELS FROM THE TOP -->
<!-- THE COORDINATES 270,350 IS LOCATED 270 PIXELS FROM THE LEFT MARGIN AND 350 PIXELS FROM THE TOP -->
<area shape="rect" coords="34,44,270,350" href="computer.htm" alt="Computer" />
<!-- THIS IS THE AREA THAT BECOMES CLICKABLE AND WILL SEND THE USER TO THE PAGE "computer.htm" -->

<!-- SHAPE="CIRCLE" -->
<!-- TO ADD A CIRCLE AREA, FIRST LOCATE THE COORDINATES OF THE CENTER OF THE CIRCLE: -->
<!-- 337,300 -->
<!-- THEN, ADD THE RADIUS OF THE CIRCLE: -->
<!-- 44 -->
<area shape="circle" coords="337,300,44" href="coffee.htm" />
<!-- THIS IS THE AREA THAT BECOMES CLICKABLE AND WILL SEND THE USER TO THE PAGE "coffee.htm" -->

<!-- SHAPE="POLY" -->
<!-- THE SHAPE="POLY" CONTAINS SEVERAL COORDINATE POINTS, WHICH CREATES A SHAPE FORMED WITH STRAIGHT LINES (A
    POLYGON) -->
<!-- THIS CAN BE USED TO CREATE ANY SHAPE -->
<!-- LIKE MAYBE A CROISSANT SHAPE -->
<!-- WE HAVE TO FIND THE X AND Y COORDINATES FOR ALL EDGES OF THE CROISSANT -->
<!-- THE COORDINATES COME IN PAIRS, ONE FOR THE X-AXIS AND ONE FOR THE Y-AXIS -->
<area
  shape="poly"
  coords="140,121,181,116,204,160,204,222,191,270,140,329,85,355,58,352,37,322,40,259,103,161,128,147"
  href="croissant.htm"
/>
<!-- THIS IS THE AREA THAT BECOMES CLICKABLE AND WILL SEND THE USER TO THE PAGE "croissant.htm" -->
