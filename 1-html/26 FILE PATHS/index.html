<!-- HTML FILE PATHS -->
<!-- A FILE PATH DESCRIBES THE LOCATION OF A FILE IN A WEB SITE'S FOLDER STRUCTURE -->
<!-- FILE PATH EXAMPLES -->

<!-- THE PICTURE.JPG FILE IS LOCATED IN THE SAME FOLDER AS THE CURRENT PAGE  -->
<img src="picture.jpg" />

<!-- THE PICTURE.JPG FILE IS LOCATED IN THE IMAGES FOLDER IN THE CURRENT FOLDER -->
<img src="images/picture.jpg" />

<!-- THE PICTURE.JPG FILE IS LOCATED IN THE IMAGES FOLDER AT THE ROOT OF THE CURRENT WEB -->
<img src="/images/picture.jpg" />

<!-- THE PCITURE.JPG FILE IS LOCATED IN THE FOLDER ONE LEVEL UP FROM THE CURRENT FOLDER -->
<img src="../picture.jpg" />

<!-- HTML FILE PATHS -->
<!-- A FILE PATH DESCRIBES THE LOCATION OF A FILE IN A WEB SITE'S FOLDER STRUCTURE -->
<!-- FILE PATHS ARE USED WHEN LINKING TO EXTERNAL FILES, LIKE -->
<!-- WEB PAGES -->
<!-- IMAGES -->
<!-- STYLE SHEETS -->
<!-- JAVASCRIPTS -->

<!-- ABSOLUTE FILE PATHS -->
<!-- AN ABSOLUTE FILE PATHS IS THE FULL URL TO A FILE -->
<!-- EXAMPLE -->
<img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain" />

<!-- RELATIVE FILE PATHS -->
<!-- A RELATIVE FILE PATHS POINTS TO A FILE RELATIVE TO THE CURRENT PAGE -->
<!-- EXAMPLE -->
<!-- IN THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLE, THE FILE PATH POINT TO A FILE IN THE IMAGES FOLDER LOCATED AT THE ROOT OF THE CURRENT
WEB -->
<img src="/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain" />

<!-- IN TEH FOLLOWING EXAMPLE, THE FILE PATH POINT TO A FILE IN THE IMAGES FOLDER LOCATED IN HTE CURRENT FOLDER -->
<img src="images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain" />

<!-- IN THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLE, THE FILE PATH POINT TO A FILE IN THE IMAGES FOLDER LOCATED IN THE FOLDER ONE LEVEL
UP FROM THE CURRENT FOLDER -->
<img src="../images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain" />

<!-- BEST PRACTICE -->
<!-- IT IS BEST PRACTICE TO USE RELATIVE FILE PATHS (IF POSSIBLE) -->
<!-- WHEN USING RELATIVE FILE PATHS, YOUR WEB PAGES WILL NOT BE BOUND TO YOUR CURRENT BASE URL. ALL LINKS WILL WORK
ON YOUR OWN COMPUTER (LOCALHOST) AS WELL AS ON YOUR CURRENT PUBLIC DOMAIN AND YOUR FUTURE PUBLIC DOMAINS -->
