<!-- HTML PARAGRAPHS -->
<!-- A PARAGRAPH ALWAYS STARTS ON A NEW LINE, AND IS USUALLY A BLOCK OF TEXT -->

<!-- HTML PARAGRAPHS -->
<!-- THE HTML <p> ELEMENT DEFINES A PARAGRAPH -->
<!-- A PARAGRAPH ALWAYS STARTS ON A NEW LINE, AND BROWSERS AUTOMATICALLY ADD SOME WHITE SPACE
(A MARGIN) BEFORE AND AFTER A PARAGRAPH -->
<!-- EXAMPLE: -->
<p>THIS IS A PARAGRAPH</p>
<p>THIS IS ANOTHER PARAGRAPH</p>

<!-- HTML DISPLAY -->
<!-- YOU CANNOT BE SURE HOW HTML WILL BE DISPLAYED -->
<!-- LARGE OR SMALL SCREENS, AND RESIZED WINDOWS WILL CREATE DIFFERENT RESULTS -->
<!-- WITH HTML, YOU CANNOT CHANGE THE DISPLAY BY ADDING EXTRA SPACES OR EXTRA LINES IN YOUR 
    HTML CODE -->
<!-- THE BROWSER WILL REMOVE ANY EXTRA SPACES AND LINES WHEN THE PAGE IS DISPLAYED -->
<!-- EXAMPLE: -->
<p>
    THIS PARAGRAPH
    CONTAINS A LOT OF LINES
    IN THE SOURCE CODE,
    BUT THE BROWSER
    IGNORES IT.
</p>

<p>
    THIS PARAGRAPH
    CONTAINS      A LOT OF SPACES
    IN THE SOURCE         CODE,
    BUT THE        BROWSER
    IGNORES IT.

<!-- HTML HORIZONTAL RULES -->
<!-- THE <hr> TAG DEFINES A THEMATIC BREAK IN AN HTML PAGE, AND IS MOST OFTEN DISPLAYED AS 
HORIZONTAL RULE -->
<!-- THE <hr> ELEMENT IS USED TO SEPARATE CONTENT (OR DEFINE A CHANGE) IN AN HTML PAGE -->
<!-- EXAMPLE: -->
<h1>THIS IS HEADING 1</h1>
<p>THIS IS SOME TEXT</p>
<hr>
<h2>THIS IS HEADING 2</h2>
<p>THIS IS SOME OTHER TEXT</p>
<hr>
<!-- THE <hr> TAG IS AN EMPTY TAG, WHICH MEANS THAT IT HAS NO END TAG -->

<!-- HTML LINE BREAKS -->
<!-- THE HTML <br> ELEMENT DEFINES A LINE BREAK -->
<!-- USE <br> IF YOU WANT A LINE BREAK (A NEW LINE) WITHOUT STARTING A NEW PARAGRAPH -->
<!-- EXAMPLE: -->
<p>
    THIS IS<br>
    A PARAGRAPH<br>
    WITH LINE BREAKS
</p>
<!-- THE <br> TAG IS AN EMPTY TAG, WHICH MEANS THAT IT HAS NO END TAG -->

<!-- THE POEM PROBLEM -->
<!-- THIS POEM WILL DISPLAY ON A SIGNLE LINE -->
<!-- EXAMPLE: -->
<p>
    MY BONNIE LIES OVER THE OCEAN

    MY BONNIE LIES OVER THE SEA

    MY BONNIE LIES OVER THE OCEAN

    OH, BRING BACK MY BONNIE TO ME
</p>

<!-- SOLUTION - THE HTML <pre> ELEMENT -->
<!-- THE HTML <pre> ELEMENT DEFINES PRE-FORMATTED TEXT -->
<!-- THE TEXT INSIDE A <pre> ELEMENT IS DISPLAYED IN A FIXED-WIDTH FONT (USUALLY COURIER), AND IT 
PRESERVES BOTH SPACES ADN LINE BREAKS -->
<!-- EXAMPLE: -->
<pre>
    MY BONNIE LIES OVER THE OCEAN

    MY BONNIE LIES OVER THE SEA

    MY BONNIE LIES OVER THE OCEAN

    OH, BRING BACK MY BONNIE TO ME
</pre>
