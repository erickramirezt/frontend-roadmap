      <h2>preventing parent overscrolling</h2>
      <p>
        use overscroll-contain to prevent scrolling in the target area from the
        triggering scrolling in the parent element, but preserve bounce effects
        when scrolling past the end of the container in operating systems that
        support it

            Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little
            stamp, the one that says "New York Public Library"? Well that may
            not mean anything to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell
            of a lot.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sure, go ahead, laugh if you want to. I've seen your type before:
            Flashy, making the scene, flaunting convention. Yeah, I know what
            you're thinking. What's this guy making such a big stink about old
            library books? Well, let me give you a hint, junior.
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe.
            Sure, we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid,
            sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local
            library and finding drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in
            the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve better?

      <h2>preventing overscroll bouncing</h2>
      <p>
        use overscroll-none to prevent scrolling in the target area from
        triggering scrolling in the parent element, and also prevent bounce
        effects when scrolling past the end of the container
      </p>

      <h2>using the default overscroll behavior</h2>

        use overscroll-auto to make it possible for the user to continue
